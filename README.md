# Implementing-Machine-Learning-to-Analyze-humans-walkings-extracted-from-micro-doppler-radar
Three experiments were examined in this technical report for digital signal processing. In experiment 1, we analyzed and examined how the fast Fourier transform (FFT) resolution was affected by adjusting the filter length, the filter type, and the FFT order. An FFT Physical resolution and a Computational Resolution were discussed in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the data was given in MATLAB and we investigated the signals concurrently in time and frequency using the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). We estimated the sampling rate and briefly discussed the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the FFT in terms of how different they are. The Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were discussed in experiment 3. We implemented an SVM to estimate four walking speeds using features extracted from simulated micro-doppler radar for walking humans. Figures of the STFT magnitude of each class are presented and discussed the basics of Doppler Effect as well as micro-doppler. We examined the results using a confusion matrix for training and testing and the best results are presented. MATLAB and related tools were used in this project and the code is provided in the report.
